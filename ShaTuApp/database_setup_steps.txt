setup.sql (base project file, same as pom.xml)

1. First setup database, see setup.sql for commands/table names.
   OR -> Log in to your DB: MySQL -u username -p
	 USE your_db_name;           
	 SOURCE /path/to/your/setup.sql;  (replace source path with yours to setup.sql)
	 

2. In CourseDAO.java and StudentDAO.java make sure the following variables are set to your environment.

    private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/student_db"; // database name based on commands in setup.sql
    private static final String USER = "ABCD";            // Your DB details - needs full privileges 
    private static final String PASSWORD = "###";         // Your DB details


3. In NetBeans > Projects window, right click on main project title > Properties

   Left side/Categories > Run section > Select either TestCourseDAO.java or TestStudentDAO.java

   OK and Close.

   When you click Run Project, it will now run main class from one of the respective classes previously mentioned. This will run a CRUD test for that particular table.
