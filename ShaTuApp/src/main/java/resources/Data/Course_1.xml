<Course id="1" title="SHA-256 Message Digest" primaryPedagogy="Fixed Sequence">
    <Description>
        Familiarizes students with the operation of the SHA-256 message digest
        algorithm along with its underlying bitwise operations and encodings.

    <Unit id="0" sequence="0" title="SHA-256: See One">
        <Description>
            In this unit, the student will see an example of how each primary
            step of the SHA-256 algorithm is performed. It also exposes the
            student to the general operation of the ShaTu application.

                  Welcome, I'm ShaTu. I'll begin by showing you how this
                  application works by demonstrating each step used to create
                  an SHA-256 message digest including the bitwise operations
                  associated with these steps.\n\n
                  When I send you an information message, like this one, all you
                  have to do is acknowledge it by pressing the 'Acknowledged'
                  button.

                  Before I have you practice the operations associated with
                  the SHA-256 algorithm, I'm going to show you how these 
                  operations work. Along the way, we'll demonstrate some of the
                  actions you can perform in this application including how
                  you can interact with me. BTW, I'm a dumb AI, so don't expect
                  too much. Once again, this is an information message, so

                  Understanding various ways in which Computer Scientist work
                  with binary representations is important for understanding
                  the operation of the SHA-256 Algorithm. Hence, let's begin
                  with an overview of these operations and how you can practice
                  using them. We won't practice now, but simply show you how
                  you'll be able to practice later on.
