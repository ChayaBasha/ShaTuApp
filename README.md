    - Popup currently only happens on click action not keystroke enter.

- Pepare Schedule (Priority Later)
    - Just has a verify button, needs to be implemented and clearer what this is supposed to do
- Initialize Variables (Priority Later)

- Compress Round (Priority Later)
    - currently shows an image, we need to make this more insructional, maybe we need the images to be able to be clicked?

- Sign In 
    - want to probably .gitignore new users

    Will neew to implement next questions 

- Dashboard to navigate to Practice/Quix/Lessons

- Whole app
    - should we have an option to make the text bigger? Typical zoom is not working on my 2013 mac. 
    - we should probably have a screen reader/read to me option so it can read aloud
    - screen should size to device
